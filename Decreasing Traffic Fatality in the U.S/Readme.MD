**Goals**
---
The United States is one of the busiest countries in terms of road traffic with nearly 280 million vehicles in operation. In 2018, there were some 12 million vehicles involved in crashes in the United States. Road collisions incur huge economic costs at a national level, which includes a burden on the health, insurance and legal systems. Moreover, they can have negative social implications for the families of those involved as well as on local communities.

The goal of this project is to group states that have similar profiles in fatal collisions. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively? Rather, than coming up with a strategy to reduce the no. of incidents of road accidents across the Country, it would be valuable to develop a state-focused plan.

**Data**
---
The data set below shows the distribution of fatal car accidents throughout the U.S. This is a sample from 2012 of reported fatal collisions per billion miles including possible causes such as speeding, alcohol impairment, distraction, prior accidents, as well as car insurance premiums and losses incurred by insurance companies. There are 51 rows indicating states and 6 columns indicating the causes.
